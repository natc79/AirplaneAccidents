# AirplaneAccidents
Analyzes data on airplane accidents in the US.  This code uses data from the National Transportation and Safety Board on airline accidents that can be found at www.data.gov.  This data contains details on when the accident occurred, where the accident occurred, the associated airline of the accident, origin and destination locations, latitude, longitude and severtiy of crash. The code first cleans the data and then uses different search algorithms to look for crashes associated with certain airports.  The main point of this project is to optimize the search algorithm so that it can find items faster using hash tables or dictionaries.  Code is also developed to undertake to computations for crash statistics.
